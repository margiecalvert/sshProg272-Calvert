"content":  "The world is charged with the grandeur of God.\nIt will flame out, like shining of torn shook foil;\nIt gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil\nCrushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?\nGenerations have trod, have trod, have trod;\nAnd all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;\nAnd wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil\nIs bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.\nAnd for all this, nature is never spent;\nThere lives the dearest freshness deep down things;\nAnd though the last lights off the black West went\nOh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--\nBecause the Holy Ghost over the bent\nWorld broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings."
